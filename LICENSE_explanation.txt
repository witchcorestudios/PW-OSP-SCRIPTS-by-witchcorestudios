The license of the original "Native" module system released by TaleWorlds is
unknown, but it remains their property. The "3 clause BSD" license in
LICENSE.txt applies to changes from that base for the "Persistent World"
module by Steven Schwartfeger (Vornne).

Basically, you can use the module system for your project as long as the
license is kept and credit is given to Persistent World as the base, but the
name "Persistent World" or close derivatives is not used without permission
to name or promote your project, to deceive people into thinking that yours is
an official version.

Using the same module directory name as an official release on a dedicated
server would only be permitted for minor bug fixes and enhancements that seem
certain not to cause compatibility problems with the corresponding official
module. Server hosters using a module tweaked from an official release should
assist in fixing related bugs reported while playing on that server, whether
by fixing the scripts, revealing the changed parts, or reverting the changes.
